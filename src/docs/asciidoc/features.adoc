== Features

This project launches a web-service that serves Javascript code snippets to convert an array of coordinates from a given Coordinate Reference System to another.

=== Limitations

* Only 2D coordinate operations are supported for now.
* Transformations based on a *datum shift grid* (such as NADCON or NTv2) are not supported yet.
* The following list of projection methods are supported:
** Equidistant Cylindrical projection (EPSG:1028),
** Lambert Conic Conformal projection (EPSG:9801, 9802, 9803, 9826, 1051),
** Mercator Cylindrical projection (EPSG:9804, 9805, 1026, 1024, 1044),
** Polar Stereographic projection (EPSG:9810, 9829, 9830),
** Transverse Mercator projection (EPSG:9807),
** Geocentric translations (EPSG:1031),
** Position Vector transformation (EPSG:1033),
** Coordinate Frame rotation (EPSG:1032).
* The following coordinate operations are supported:
** Pass-through operation,
** Concatenated operation.
